# Understanding Neural Network Weights Through Visualization

Date: 2024-01-15

Struggling with understanding how weights work in neural networks? I've created a Streamlit app that visualizes neural network weights as layers of valves, helping you understand how weight adjustments affect the network's output.

## The Challenge

Many developers understand the theory behind neural networks but struggle to visualize how they actually work. This interactive visualization tool helps bridge that gap.
